    <p>
      Alignment is one of the most important design principles. It helps ensure a sharp, ordered appearance for ultimately better designs by ensuring your various elements of design have a pleasing connection with each other. Here we see how pictures go hand in hand, similar tones and colors  as well as the order. In lomography you get too see different styles of film camaras pictures, because of the way they display this pictures you get to see more in less time.

      <p>
        The rule of thirds in graphic design divides a canvas into three even rows and three even columns. The four central intersections where the lines meet are the key “hot spots” where you should aim to place your main subjects, as those are where people's attention immediately lands. In many clothing online stores you get too this pattern, by example the girls head, is exaclty on the imagianry line.

    <div id="section3"> 
    <h3>Virgiinia Orosa Web Page</h3>
    <h3><a href="https://www.virginiaorosa.com/">https://www.virginiaorosa.com/</a></h3>

    <p>
      Contrast creates visual differences between elements. Emphasis allows the designer to draw the viewer's attention to a specific element. In this web page we get too see how she played with the color, and even though this colors are really close she still got to make it visually appealing enough so it calls your attention.
